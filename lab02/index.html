            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p> My first webpage! To begin with, HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language
                is used to structure and build websites. The process seems overwhelming at the 
                beginning, because there are many tags and structures needed to build a successfull 
                webpage. But the process is manageable and can be implemented slowly while creating a webpage.
                This learning process and practice taught me a lot how to display and build properly HTML webpages.
