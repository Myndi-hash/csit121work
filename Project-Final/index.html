            <h3>Reflection and Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>
                The Final Project has been challenging as it requires more technical expectise
                in using html, css and external resources to build the portfolio. Brainstorming how
                to go about building the project was hard as I confused with where to start with, but 
                with persitence; I have been to gather the essentials, and put my learned skills to 
                practice. Building the project bar menu and make it responsive was challenging, choosing
                the right color to make it cohesive with the entire site was time consumming as well choosing 
                the right color to build the entire project.

                Fisrt I went through making the differents pages step by step, then I worked on adjusting my css 
                differents properties to fit my design. Some challenges came along the way, but I used my previous
                labs to review certains key apesct and tried to impliment them into this one. I started to have more 
                confidence as the project started taking form and that give me more incentive to complete my design.I 
                had to consult external link on how to:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <a>Properly link multiple pages</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a>Use CSS to add color and other important porperties</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a>Use media query to make it responsive with screen size changes</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank"> Resource Link</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"> Resource Link</a>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p> I also observed that the design was not properly fitting the page as I wanted when the 
                    screen gets to certain resolution, so I worked on adjusting some properties to make it 
                    fit better. This course as a whole taught me a lot in term of skills, confidence, and patience.
                    I learned how to build a website with multiple pages and also how to make it available on the 
                    internet using file transfert protocol.
