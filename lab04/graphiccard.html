            <h2>Nvidia Card Description</h2>
            <p>
                A Grahpic card which is also called video card or graphic processing unit is a basically
                a hardware component responsibles for displaying images, animations , and videos on your
                computer monitor. The graphic card is benefecial for task that requires graphic modelling 
                either through video edtitg, three-dimensional modeling, and gaming. With graphic Card
                users can experience enhance performance and smother visuals.

            <h2> Image Type information</h2>
            <p>
                The image is in a JPEG format, defined as Joint Photographic Expert Group. This format is mostly used
                for photograpghs. The benefits from JPEG are the presence of a multitiude of colors(millions in this case), 
                uses lossy compression, cannot be animated and cannot be transparent.

            <h2>Why I choose this Image</h2>
            <p>
                I choose this image because I have a passion for computer, and I like to spend my free time playing video games.
                It's interresting to learn more about GPU, and how it affects my game performance overall. With more understanding 
                I can be able to choose the right graphic card for better performance during my play time.
