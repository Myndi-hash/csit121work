            <h2>Pyramid Description</h2>
            <p>
                The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It served as the tomb
                of Pharaoh Khufu who ruled during the fourth dynasty of the old Kingdom. The pyramid
                stands on 481 feet long, and represents the tallest human-made strucutre for more that 3800 years.
                The base was measured to be about 755,6 ft square. The pyramid of giza was built by quarrying
                roughly 2.3million large blocks, weighing each 6 million tonnes in total.
