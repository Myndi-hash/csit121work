                <h2>Lab1&2 Summary Notes</h2>
                <p> My first webpage! To begin with, HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language
                    is used to structure and build websites. The process seems overwhelming at the 
                    beginning, because there are many tags and structures needed to build a successfull 
                    webpage. But the process is manageable and can be implemented slowly while creating
                     a webpage.This learning process and practice taught me a lot how to display and build 
                    properly HTML webpages.

            <h3>Ressources I used:</h3>
            <p class="notes">Learning about structuring text in HTML was very helpful, as it allows 
                me to have better understanding of the steps i need to take to build a successfull 
                webpage structure. Below, I have included some links, very ressourful that I used during 
                my webpage projects.

           <p>
            In lab 03, It was more of an introduction to CSS, which stands for Cascasding Style Sheets. Css is the language that is
            used to describe how to display HTML file. It defines the type of color, text, background prperties, and more.
            Css has no syntax compare to html, however, css uses selectors to impliment properties. The rule of a css are comprised of
            selector, prperty, statement and values.HTML selectors define how element should be displayed in between the opening and
            closing of an html tags. An ID selector is used to apply specific properties to only one element. Lastly, I learned also
            about the Class Selector which can be used to define properties to any number of elements via the class attribute.

            <h4>Lab05 Summary</h4>
           <p>
           Lab05 was lttle challenging for me; I had to learn more new syntax with CSS and to apply them to my lab03 while respecting 
           the requirements for this assignment. I learned how to make a css layout, the building blocks of responsive web design. I read more 
           about Normal flow, Flexbox, Grid, what a responsive design mean and the differents elements such as viewport, media queries, responsive
           image, etc... I explore more how to configure margin, padding, how to set a single side of padding or margin, and how to use borders.
           I learned what a Block level element in HTML is and what are they characteristics. Further, I learned about grid container(parent and children) 
           and common css declarations both for flexbox and grid designs.
